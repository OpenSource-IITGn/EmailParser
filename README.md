# EmailParser
This tool is for parsing email information about seminars, workshops and various events which can now be populated in a table that can be used to create by other applications to display and use information for informing and reminding people about various events.

# Vision and Contribution

The current work is more of a simple parsing and table population application and do not provide an API. Anyone who wishes to contribute to fulfill this vision is welcome. Contributions improving code structure, project structure and documentation are also welcome.
